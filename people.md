Stefano Cherubin is the founder the TAFFO project, and the one who chose its name.

He is a Lecturer at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (United Kingdom).
He received his Ph.D. in Information Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) in 2019 with a thesis on Compiler-Assisted Dynamic Precision Tuning.
His research interests include compilers, and approximate computing.


## Daniele Cattaneo

Daniele Cattaneo is one of the two first contributors to TAFFO, as he worked on the initial floating-point to fixed-point conversion pass, and later on most of the remaining infrastructure
He is now working on TAFFO as part of his Ph.D. at Politecnico di Milano.

Daniele Cattaneo has earned his M.Sc. graduation cum laude in Computer Science
and Engineering in December 2018, with a thesis work based on the architecture
and implementation of a mixed precision compiler which exploits the fixed point
numerical representation.
Currently he is a Ph.D. student at Politecnico di Milano. His research
interests involve embedded systems, compiler technology and software-hardware
codesign.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/mic.jpg" height=page.bioheight align="right" class="round" href="https://michiari.github.io/" %}

Michele Chiari mainly contributed to TAFFO's value-range and error analyses,
as well as other parts of its architecture.

He is a PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano, where he
earned his M.Sc. in 2018. His research interests cover formal methods,
focusing on temporal logic in particular, and software
verification. He is also interested in approximate computing and its
intersection with formal methods.


## Gabriele Magnani

Gabriele Magnani developed FixM, TAFFO's custom fixed-point mathematical library function generator,
and is currently working on supporting more output numeric representations in TAFFO.

He is a M.Sc. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.


## Giovanni Agosta

Giovanni Agosta is the academic supervisor of the TAFFO project.

Giovanni Agosta is Associate Professor at Politecnico di Milano, where
he received his Ph.D. in 2004 and the MS degree (Laurea) in 2000. His
research interests focus on compiler technologies for the enforcement
of extra functional properties. He has published over 100 papers in
international journals and conferences.  He is a senior member of the
ACM, a member of the HiPEAC NoE, an associate editor of SoftwareX, and
is currently the technical manager of the RECIPE research project.
