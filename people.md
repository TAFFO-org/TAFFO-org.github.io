## [Stefano Cherubin](https://cherubin.faculty.polimi.it/){:target="_blank"}

Stefano Cherubin is a Lecturer at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (United Kingdom).
He received his Ph.D. in Information Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) in 2019 with a thesis on Compiler-Assisted Dynamic Precision Tuning.
His research interests include compilers, and approximate computing.

He is the founder of the TAFFO project.


## Daniele Cattaneo

Daniele Cattaneo has earned his M.Sc. graduation cum laude in Computer Science
and Engineering in December 2018, with a thesis work based on the architecture
and implementation of a mixed precision compiler which exploits the fixed point
numerical representation.
Currently he is a Ph.D. student at Politecnico di Milano. His research
interests involve embedded systems, compiler technology and software-hardware
codesign.

He is one of the two first contributors to TAFFO, as he worked on the initial floating-point to fixed-point conversion pass, and later on most of the remaining infrastructure.
He is now working on TAFFO as part of his Ph.D. at Politecnico di Milano.


## [Michele Chiari](https://michiari.github.io/){:target="_blank"}

Michele Chiari is a PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano, where he
earned his M.Sc. in 2018. His research interests cover formal methods,
focusing on temporal logic in particular, and software
verification. He is also interested in approximate computing and its
intersection with formal methods.

He mainly contributed to TAFFO's value-range and error analyses,
as well as other parts of its architecture.


## Gabriele Magnani

Gabriele Magnani received his MSc in Computer Science and Engineering in 2021 at Politecnico di Milano, with a thesis on precision tuning of mathematically intensive programs.
Currently he is a collaborator on the TAFFO project, still at Politecnico di Milano, and his research interests involve the application of precision tuning in a concrete applicative context.

He developed FixM, TAFFO's custom fixed-point mathematical library function generator,
and is currently working on supporting more output numeric representations in TAFFO.


## [Giovanni Agosta](https://agosta.faculty.polimi.it/doku.html)

Giovanni Agosta is Associate Professor at Politecnico di Milano, where
he received his Ph.D. in 2004 and the MS degree (Laurea) in 2000. His
research interests focus on compiler technologies for the enforcement
of extra functional properties. He has published over 100 papers in
international journals and conferences.  He is a senior member of the
ACM, a member of the HiPEAC NoE, an associate editor of SoftwareX, and
is currently the technical manager of the RECIPE research project.

He is the academic supervisor of the TAFFO project.

## Antonio Di Bello

Antonio Di Bello graduated in Computer Science and Engineering in December 2018 from Politecnico di Milano.

He is one of the two first contributor to TAFFO, together with Daniele Cattaneo.


## Nicola Fossati

Nicola Fossati received his MSc in Computer Science and Engineer in 2020 at Politecnico di Milano, with a thesis on linear programming applied to mixed precision tuning.
Currently he is an Embedded Systems Engineer.
His research interests focus on embedded systems and mixed precision tuning.

He developed TAFFO's new data-type allocation engine, based on Integer Linear Programming.
